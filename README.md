2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Constraints:

n == nums.length

m == queries.length

1 <= n, m <= 1000

1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 106
