931. Minimum Falling Path Sum


Given an n x n array of integers matrix, return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be (row + 1, col - 1), (row + 1, col), or (row + 1, col + 1).

Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length

1 <= n <= 100

-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
