# leetcode_question

Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.

Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: path = "NES"

Output: false 

Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

Input: path = "NESWW"


Output: true


Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.



 

Constraints:

1 <= path.length <= 104


path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.
