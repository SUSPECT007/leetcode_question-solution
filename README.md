2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105

edges[i].length == 2

0 <= ai, bi < n

ai != bi

There are no repeated edges.
