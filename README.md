Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true


Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]


Output: false
